Announcement on the List of Representative Teams for RMU 2025

2024-10-21

RoboMaster University Series (RMU) emcompasses RoboMaster University Championship (RMUC) and RoboMaster University League (RMUL). According to the requirements stated in the Participant Manual ( https://www.robomaster.com/en-US/resource/pages/announcement/1774 ) :

1. The participating team must be affiliated to a university or college and obtain the authorized stamp of the university or college (campus).

2. A team can apply for more than one competitions in the RMU. The RoboMaster Organizing Committee (RMOC) will deem a team participating in different competitions in the same season as the one and same group, in handling the various competition processes. Any team participating in different competitions must use the same team name.

3. No more than two teams of each university is eligible for one challenge or event.

The RMOC encourages universities and participating teams to actively leverage internal and external resources, improve technical and managerial abilities, pass on their legacy, and create a healthy and sustainable environment for the RoboMaster competition. According to the above principles and the registration review results since RMUC 2020, the RMOC hereby announces the list of representative teams as follows.

I. The representative team has the priority to participate in RMUC, RMUL to obtain scores. The participation priority of RMU teams are as follows:

1. Representative teams (see the table below) that have submitted registration application in the current season;

2. Teams that have submitted the registration application in the current season with a longer participation history of the applied event;

3. Teams that have received Letter of Authorization ( https://www.robomaster.com/en-US/resource/pages/announcement/1776 ) from the university or college in the current season;

In addition to the requirements stated in the Participant Manuals for RMU 2025, teams should also adhere to the following principle: If a representative team and a non-representative team of the same university participate in different events of RMU, the score of the university will depend on the competition results of the representative team according to the RoboMaster Scoring and Ranking System ( https://www.robomaster.com/en-US/robo/rm/integral ).

II. The list of representative teams will be updated according to the RMUC registration review results. If a university wants to replace the representative team or modify key information of the team (see the "Five Differences" principle in Participant Manual ( https://www.robomaster.com/en-US/resource/pages/announcement/1774 ) ), it must present the "Replacement Statement of the Representative Team", and the RMOC will update the information accordingly.

1.Each university has one opportunity to modify the team name. If a representative team only wants to modify the team name, they should contact the RMOC (WeChat: rmsaiwu)  after submitting the registration information. A team cannot modify its team name after the registration period. Although RMU events are mutually independent, any team participating in different events must use the same team name.

2.A team can mofdify the prefix of its team name due to the change of title sponsor.

III. If a non-representative team of the same school wants to participate in certain competitions (challenges) in RMU, they need to negotiate with the representative team. If the representative team voluntarily waives the qualification of the competitions (challenges), the RMOC will approve the registration application of the non-representative team.
