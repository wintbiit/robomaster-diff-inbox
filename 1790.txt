|                                | resources). This should be a   |
|                                | recapitulative description.    |
|                                | Figures should be included     |
|                                | in the team’s budget report.   |

|                                | The categorization should      |
|                                | be exhaustive and clear; the   |
|                                | budget for robot development   |
|                                | and lab management should be   |

Season Plan Assessment: Rating Criteria

+--------------------------------+----------+
| *Content*                      | *Rating* |
| The Season Plan is written in  | S        |
| accordance with requirements   |          |
| and is complete without        |          |
| any omissions or missing       |          |
| information. The plan is       |          |
| based on the team’s actual     |          |
| situation, with clear and      |          |
| reasonable goals, and fully    |          |
| demonstrated feasibility. Team |          |
| management planning is clear,  |          |
| cost planning and budget is    |          |
| reasonable, and the business   |          |
| and promotional planning is    |          |
| complete. The plan is highly   |          |
| instructive for tasks during   |          |
| the Preparation Period, with   |          |
| innovative analysis methods    |          |
| used or extensive details      |          |
| provided. The plan also        |          |
| provides other teams with      |          |
| useful insights or methods for |          |
| Preparation Period tasks.      |          |
| The Season Plan is written in  | A        |
| accordance with requirements   |          |
| and is complete without        |          |
| any omissions or missing       |          |
| information. The plan is       |          |
| based on the team’s actual     |          |
| situation, with clear          |          |
| and reasonable goals, and      |          |
| adequately demonstrated        |          |
| feasibility. Team management   |          |
| planning is clear, cost        |          |
| planning and budget is         |          |
| reasonable, and the business   |          |
| and promotional planning is    |          |
| complete. The plan is highly   |          |
| instructive for tasks during   |          |
| the Preparation Period.        |          |
| The Season Plan is written in  | B        |
| accordance with requirements   |          |
| and is complete without        |          |
| any omissions or missing       |          |
| information. The plan is       |          |
| based on the team’s actual     |          |
| situation, with relatively     |          |
| clear and reasonable goals,    |          |
| and adequately demonstrated    |          |
| feasibility. Team management   |          |
| planning, cost planning,       |          |
| and budget have some room      |          |
| for improvement. Business      |          |
| and promotional planning is    |          |
| basically complete. The plan   |          |
| is instructive for tasks       |          |
| during the Preparation Period. |          |
| The Season Plan has some       | C        |
| omissions or deviations from   |          |
| the content requirements.      |          |
| The plan strays from the       |          |
| team’s actual situation,       |          |
| with relatively clear          |          |
| and reasonable goals, and      |          |
| acceptable demonstrated        |          |
| feasibility (with a few        |          |
| feasibility issues).           |          |
| Team management planning,      |          |
| cost planning, and budget      |          |
| have significant room for      |          |
| improvement. Business and      |          |
| promotional planning lacks     |          |
| some information. The plan     |          |
| is instructive for short-term  |          |
| tasks during the Preparation   |          |
| Period.                        |          |
| The Season Plan has serious    | D        |
| omissions or major deviations  |          |
| from the content requirements. |          |
| The plan far strays from       |          |
| the team’s actual situation    |          |
| and lacks feasibility          |          |
| demonstration (with many       |          |
| feasibility issues). The       |          |
| methods are not executable,    |          |
| and the goals are not clear    |          |
| or reasonable. Team management |          |
| planning, cost planning, and   |          |
| budget have significant room   |          |
| for improvement. Business and  |          |
| promotional planning lacks     |          |
| lots of information. The plan  |          |
| is not instructive for tasks   |          |
| during the Preparation Period. |          |
